# Magnetic-Field-Decomposition
A program to decompose magnetic field of a dipole magnet into harmonics.

Dipole (B), Quadrupole (G), Sextupole (S) and Octupole (O) harmonics are presented.

Using a magnetic field map, particle tracking searches a reference orbit for the decomposition. Equations of motion are solved via Runge-Kutta numerical algorithm.
